                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>Looking for someone who can listen and develop what you actually need? Here is a little bit about us
                    and what we offer.</p>
                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>At Mi-Way Business Solutions, we build solutions around <strong>you</strong>. We're a
                    <strong>Manchester-based startup</strong> with a simple goal: to help businesses run smarter with
                    technology and design that fits <em>your</em> way of working.
                </p>
<br>
                <p>Our team is made up of individuals with real experience across the industry — from working with
                    Microsoft Business Central development partners to delivering full-scale digital design projects. We
                    may be new as a company, but our expertise runs deep.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>We specialise in platforms like <strong>Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central</strong>,
                    <strong>website development</strong>, and <strong>graphic design</strong>, but we're not limited to
                    these. Whether it's a fully custom solution or one of our growing range of ready-made products,
                    we’re here to build exactly what your business needs.
                </p>

                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p>We’ve worked inside the Microsoft partner network, consulted with all kinds of businesses, and seen
                    firsthand what makes a solution <em>actually</em> useful. That knowledge fuels everything we build.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Here’s what we offer:</p>

                <br>
                <p><strong>Business Central Development</strong><br>
                    Deep customisation and smart enhancements that make Business Central work harder for your team. We
                    support:</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong>Web Design & Development</strong><br>
                    Modern, responsive websites designed to engage, convert, and grow with your business — from basic
                    pages to full applications.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong>Graphic Design & Branding</strong><br>
                    Visual storytelling through clean, consistent, and impactful design. Logos, brand packs, marketing
                    visuals — whatever you need.</p>

                <br>

                <p>We’re also developing our <strong>own software products</strong>, designed to solve real-world
                    business pain points with simplicity and efficiency.</p>

                <h2>Why Work With Us?</h2>
                <p>Because we get it — you don’t need another off-the-shelf product. You need something that actually
                    works for how <em>you</em> do business.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We bring together <strong>technical experience</strong>, <strong>creative thinking</strong>, and a
                    no-nonsense approach to problem solving. Whether you're looking to modernise systems, streamline
                    processes, or refresh your brand, we're here to help you do it — with flexibility, transparency, and
                    attention to detail.</p>

                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <p>We're guided by a simple belief: when you focus on the customer’s needs first, great solutions
                    follow. We listen, we build around your requirements, and we support you every step of the way.</p>
                <br>

                <p>As we like to say:</p>
                <h3><em>"Have it your way... with Mi-Way."</em></h3>

                <p>Let’s build something that works — for your people, your process, and your goals.
