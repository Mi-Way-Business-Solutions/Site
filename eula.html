                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        This End-User License Agreement is entered into by and between Mi-Way Business Solutions,
                        referred
                        to as “we,” “us,” or “Mi-Way,” and you, the client (“you” or “Client”). This Agreement governs
                        your
                        use of deliverables, software, integrations, designs, and services provided by Mi-Way Business
                        Solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe in working collaboratively and transparently. This Agreement sets expectations and
                        ensures fairness for both sides.
                    </p>

                    <h2>1. Scope of Services</h2>
                    <p>
                        This Agreement applies to all work performed by Mi-Way Business Solutions, including but not
                        limited
                        to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central custom development and configuration;</li>
                        <li>Integration between Business Central and third-party applications (e.g. MobileNAV, APIs or
                            EDI
                            providers);</li>
                        <li>Web application and website development;</li>
                        <li>Graphic design and branding services;</li>
                        <li>Deployment or use of proprietary tools or internal software developed by Mi-Way.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>2. Ownership & Licensing</h2>

                    <h3>2.1 Client-Owned Deliverables</h3>
                    <p>
                        Any work created at your request—such as source code, integrations, designs, and related
                        assets—will
                        become your property upon full payment. This includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Business Central extensions and configurations;</li>
                        <li>Custom-built web applications and websites;</li>
                        <li>Logos, digital designs, and creative assets;</li>
                        <li>Documentation and supporting files.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Where possible, source files and technical documentation will be delivered to enable continued
                        use
                        or development.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2.2 Use of Internal Tools or Proprietary Products</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mi-Way may use its own tools, templates, or pre-built modules to support your project. These
                        internal components remain the property of Mi-Way unless explicitly licensed otherwise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you choose to use or retain such functionality after the project:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You may be required to enter a separate licensing agreement or pay applicable usage fees;
                        </li>
                        <li>If the license is not accepted or lapses, functionality related to these internal components
                            may
                            be disabled;</li>
                        <li>This will not affect your ownership of any custom-developed features.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. Third-Party Tools, Services & Integrations</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are responsible for reviewing and complying with third-party licensing and terms of
                            service;
                        </li>
                        <li>Mi-Way will disclose known third-party dependencies and provide guidance where possible;
                        </li>
                        <li>We are not liable for ongoing availability, changes, or costs associated with third-party
                            tools
                            or services.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. Warranty & Liability</h2>
                    <p>
                        All deliverables are provided “as-is”. While Mi-Way commits to quality and professionalism:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free performance;</li>
                        <li>Our liability for any claim under this Agreement is limited to the total fees paid by you
                            for
                            the specific service in question.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>5. Support & Maintenance</h2>
                    <p>
                        Unless otherwise agreed:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Support, maintenance, hosting, or updates are not included by default;</li>
                        <li>Post-delivery support may be arranged and billed separately;</li>
                        <li>You are responsible for maintaining backups, hosting, and system environments, unless
                            specifically contracted with Mi-Way.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>6. Confidentiality</h2>
                    <p>
                        Both parties agree to protect confidential and proprietary information shared during the
                        project.
                        This includes business data, trade secrets, and sensitive project details, and the obligation
                        remains in effect even after the project concludes.
                    </p>

                    <h2>7. Data Protection</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mi-Way Business Solutions is committed to protecting your data. All processing of personal data
                        is
                        handled in accordance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and related data
                        protection laws. A separate Privacy Policy is available detailing how data is collected, stored,
                        and
                        used.
                    </p>

                    <h2>8. Connectivity & Updates</h2>
                    <p>
                        Some services may require Internet connectivity to enable features, validate licenses, or
                        deliver
                        updates. These connections will comply with Mi-Way’s privacy policy and all applicable data
                        protection regulations.
                    </p>

                    <h2>9. Non-Exclusivity</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mi-Way may provide similar services to other clients, provided your confidential information is
                        not
                        reused or disclosed.
                    </p>

                    <h2>10. Force Majeure</h2>
                    <p>
                        Neither party shall be held liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond their control,
                        such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, regulatory changes, or service outages.
                    </p>

                    <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
                    <p>
                        This Agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes will be subject to the
                        exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
                    </p>

                    <h2>12. Entire Agreement</h2>
